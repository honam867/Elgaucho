Jean-Pierre Moueix, who established his wine merchant business in Libourne in 1937, purchased La Fleur-Pétrus in 1950. This historic estate on the plateau of Pomerol was his first vineyard acquisition.La Fleur-Pétrus is composed predominantly of Merlot, which lends silkiness and generosity to the wine, while a small percentage of Cabernet Franc contributes rigor and complexity.The vineyard is made up of three parcels on the plateau of Pomerol with altitudes averaging 33 to 38 meters above sea level. The pebbly soils from the northern parcel yield a wine of great elegance with notes of black cherries. The center plot, known for its summer heat (the area is called “Tropchaud”}, produces a wine of tremendous suppleness with a hint of plum. Wine from the southern parcel is particularly velvety, dense, structured, with a pronounced nose of blackcurrant.Blended, these three singular terroirs with nuanced and complementary characteristics produce a generous, expressive wine with apparent structure and a dominance of black fruit. An attentive tasting reveals remarkable refinement, complexity, and a touch of violet.",

In Apalta, vines are planted on 45° slopes, providing good exposure to achieve ripeness. Cool ocean breezes and low nighttime temperatures moderate this warm area, permitting slow development and retention of varietal aromas and acidity. Marchigüe is slightly cooler because of its closer proximity to the ocean. Conditions are dry, reducing the threat of fungal disease and resulting in consistently healthy harvests. All grapes were hand harvested.Purple Angel displays the rich flavours typical of Carménère. The addition of Petit Verdot gives spice, colour, structure and acidity. Deep ruby red in colour, the wine has alluring red and blackberry notes on the nose. The palate is densely concentrated, with spice and mocha lingering on the finish.",

There’s a predominance of red berries, jam, blackcurrant liqueur (creme de cassis}, and a juicy sensation of crushed strawberries. Eight months in contact with French oak lend it a certain degree of seriousness, along with a bit of vanilla, smoke, cigar box, and sweet spices. Good balance on the palate with properly rounded tannins that enable this Cabernet Sauvignon to linger long on the palate.Highly recommended with braised beef with French fries, steak and eggs, paella, cannelloni, and lasagna.Wine Spectator – “There’s minerally freshness to the ripe dark plum, blackberry and cherry flavors, with peppery hints. Well-structured and crisp midpalate, featuring Asian spice and black fig notes on the finish. Drink now through 2020.”",

The grapes then undergo an extended maceration and a long, cool fermentation for increased flavor, color and aroma. Aged in 50% new French oak barrels, the wine matures for 22 months before being deemed ready for release. Our Napa Cabernet bottling is always blended with other Bordeaux varietals for their added aromatic and balanced tannin contributions.A quintessential Napa Cabernet, this wine is rich and dark in the glass. Aromas of blackberry and faint dried herb waft up from the rim towards you. Upon tasting, the wine has a broad and pleasant entry, moving to a focused and weighty mid palate with notes of cassis, toast and graphite. A lengthy finish shows well proportioned tannin that will gain even more complexity as time passes. With proper cellaring, this wine will drink beautifully for the next 15 years.",

Spicy and balsamic sensations give additional complexity in the layers of aromatics. The wine is ample and enveloping on the palate with supple tannins and a savory freshness that fully respects the character and personality of the Sangiovese grape. The balance between acidity and tannins is excellent and the finish and aftertaste are of a lovely length and persistence.James Suckling – “This is amazing on the nose with blackberry, black truffle, dried cherry and hints of tobacco. So complex on the nose. Almost no need to taste it. Full body, soft and velvety tannins, and a persistent, fabulous finish. The mouthfeel is magic. 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink or hold.”",
